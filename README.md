# ðŸš—| LuxCar Website - Luxury Car Rental in Monaco
#### STATUS: This project is still under development

## About the Project
Inspired by Monaco, I created a website for luxury car rentals, offering vehicles from the most prestigious and expensive brands, such as Mercedes, Audi, BMW, Porsche, Ferrari, Lamborghini, Bugatti, and McLaren.  

The website features a responsive design, ensuring a great experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. It includes:  
- **Interactive menu**: Internal links that redirect users to pages like *About Us* and *Contact Us*.  
- **Rental options in the header**: Users can choose to rent by distance or by hour and are redirected to the corresponding page (under development).  
- **"Car Category" section**: A carousel showcasing top brands. Clicking on a brand takes users to a dedicated page with all available models, including prices and essential details (under development).  
- **Statistics section**: Displays key figures highlighting the company's milestones and achievements.  
- **Feedback section**: Shows the top 4 user reviews. Users can also submit their own reviews or view more reviews using customizable filters.  
- **"Best Offer" section**: Regularly updated to showcase the deal of the day.  
- **FAQ section**: Answers common questions and provides email or phone contact options if further assistance is needed.  

## About the Design
The website design was completely designed by me after finishing the Origamid UI course for beginners, in oreder ot put all the knowledge acquired during the course.  This includes:
- **Prototyping:** Planning the layout and functionality of the site.
- **Typography:** Choosing fonts that enhance readability and visual appeal.
- Harmony and Contrast:** Balancing elements to create a visually pleasing interface.
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Organizing information to guide the user's attention effectively.
